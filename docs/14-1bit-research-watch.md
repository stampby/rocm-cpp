## Live entries (2026)

### BitDecoding — Low-bit KV cache with Tensor Cores (arxiv:2503.18773)
**Takeaway:** CUDA+Tensor Core pipeline for low-bit KV cache GEMV in long-context
decode. Dequant kernel + GEMM overlap + extra metadata movement. Claims up to
**8.6× over FP16 FlashDecoding-v2** on long-context workloads.
**Relevance:** **WE DO NOT HAVE A KV CACHE KERNEL.** The library currently
ships a prefill GEMM + decode weight-GEMV path but doesn't touch KV cache
attention compute. Adding a low-bit KV cache variant is the next real
feature-level gap for long-context usage. Porting their software-pipeline
approach to gfx11 WMMA would be 1–2 sessions of kernel work.
**Status:** FLAGGED — next feature. Phase 6 candidate.

### Arbitrary Precision Acceleration for LLMs on GPU Tensor Cores (arxiv:2409.17870)
**Takeaway:** Bit-level matrix decomposition recovers arbitrary-precision
matmul on tensor cores. Includes W1A2 (1-bit weights, 2-bit activations)
schemes. Flexible precision on fixed-width hardware.
**Relevance:** Our Phase 5 is W1.58A8. Their W1A2 scheme would cut both
weight and activation bandwidth further on gfx11 WMMA. Requires custom
bit-serial accumulation logic — non-trivial port. Read for technique,
not direct adoption.
**Status:** FLAGGED — future research lever.

### ButterflyQuant — Ultra-low-bit via butterfly transforms (arxiv:2509.09679, Feb 2026)
**Takeaway:** Replaces Hadamard rotation in quant pipelines with learnable
butterfly transforms. O(n log n), smooth optimization, orthogonality preserved.
Targets 2-bit regime where activation outliers kill naive quant.
**Relevance:** Training-side. Could help if we ever do our own QAT training
of a BitNet-variant. Not a kernel thing.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Flag for training side.

### LittleBit — 0.1 BPW via latent factorization (arxiv:2506.13771, Feb 2026)
**Takeaway:** Sub-1-bit quantization down to 0.1 BPW (10× below BitNet 1.58).
31× memory vs FP16. Llama2-13B fits in 0.9 GB. Factorization approach, not
direct ternary.
**Relevance:** Weights format is completely different from BitNet ternary —
factored low-rank approximation, not ternary codes. Our Phase 5 GEMV kernel
wouldn't apply. Watch if it matures; would need an entirely new kernel class.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Watch maturity.

### BTC-LLM — Sub-1-bit via adaptive transform + binary codebook (arxiv:2506.12040, Nov 2025)
**Takeaway:** Sub-1-bit LLM quant. Claims **surpasses FP16 baseline on
LLaMA-1-30B** under aggressive compression. Binary codebook with
learnable transforms.
**Relevance:** Different encoding (binary codebook, not ternary). Doesn't
feed into our Phase 5 path but competitive positioning matters — their
story is "sub-1-bit and still beats FP16." If adoption picks up, the
community's reference 1-bit stack shifts.
**Status:** WATCH. Not kernel-actionable today.

### ParetoQ — Unified training+quant for sub-4-bit (arxiv:2502.02631, Oct 2025)
**Takeaway:** First unified approach for sub-4-bit training and quant.
Pareto-optimal scaling laws.
**Relevance:** Training-side. Defines "what tradeoff to train for" in
quant regime we care about.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Training reference.

### BitNet Distillation (arxiv:2510.13998)
**Takeaway:** Distill full-precision teacher LLMs down to BitNet b1.58 students.
**Relevance:** Training pipeline for our QAT work. Not kernel.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Training reference.

### Continual QAT Pre-Training for BitNet (arxiv:2502.11895)
**Takeaway:** Train FP16 first, then transition to 1.58-bit QAT. Better than
1.58-bit-from-scratch. Open question: when to transition.
**Relevance:** Training-side. The "transition moment" question is their
open problem. Not kernel.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Training reference.

### MAGNET — Autonomous expert generation + BitNet training (arxiv:2603.25813)
**Takeaway:** 618M BitNet b1.58 model + decentralized autoresearch framework
for expert generation.
**Relevance:** Shows BitNet adoption beyond Microsoft's own models. Good
signal for ecosystem momentum.
**Status:** NO ACTION. Ecosystem watch.

### Sparse-BitNet (arxiv:2603.05168, March 2026)
**Takeaway:** 1.58-bit BitNet weights naturally are ~42% zeros — semi-structured
sparsity comes for free.
**Relevance:** Our Phase 5 kernel already branchlessly skips zeros on compute
(the `(bits==1) - (bits==2)` expression yields 0). But we still issue the A
LDS read for zero-weight positions. A sparse-aware B encoding that packs only
non-zero positions could cut LDS reads further. gfx11 lacks 2:4 sparse WMMA,
so the win has to come from CSR-style iteration, not hardware sparsity.
**Status:** NOT INTEGRATED. Future Phase 5.2 candidate.

### BitNet b1.58 2B4T Technical Report (arxiv:2504.12285, March 2026)
**Takeaway:** The exact model we benchmark against. Confirms 2B params, 4T
tokens, ternary weights, 8-bit activations.
**Relevance:** Our Phase 5 matches their activation precision (INT8). Sim
says we beat their reference decode by 2.20x on gfx1151.
**Status:** Confirmed arch match. No change needed to our kernels.

### BitNet a4.8 — 4-bit Activations for 1-bit LLMs (Microsoft Research)
**Takeaway:** Move from INT8 to INT4 activations with per-group scales.
Claims further compute savings.
**Relevance:** Tested naïve INT4-A (Phase 5.1, kernels/ternary_gemv_phase5_i4a.hip)
with per-tensor scale. Result: 0.96-1.15x (wash) on our shapes because we're
compute-bound, not bandwidth-bound. Correctness collapses with per-tensor
scale — a4.8's actual value is the per-group scale scheme, NOT raw INT4.
**Status:** NEGATIVE-RESULT variant shipped in-tree for reference. Proper
per-group INT4 is scope for Phase 5.2.

### Tequila — Deadzone-free Ternary Quant (ICLR 2026 OpenReview)
**Takeaway:** 3.0x inference speedup on their stack via avoiding the "dead
zone" around zero.
**Relevance:** Our Phase 5 dot4 hits 3.4-5.5x on gfx1151 via INT8 A + dot4
builtin, so we already meet/exceed this perf target. Their training-time
contribution (dead-zone avoidance in quant) is orthogonal to kernel work.
**Status:** No kernel action. Flag for our QAT training side if that becomes
relevant.

### Bitnet.cpp — Efficient Edge Inference for Ternary LLMs (arxiv:2502.11880, Feb 2025)
**Takeaway:** Microsoft's CPU inference paper. TL1/TL2 lookup-table schemes,
6.25x over FP baseline, 2.32x over low-bit baseline on CPU.
**Relevance:** CPU-only. We ship GPU kernels. Our Phase 5 on gfx1151 does
10.8 us on 2560x2560; their AMD EPYC 7543 result on 2048x2048 is 93.276 ms
(from Microsoft's BitNet src/README). Two to three orders of magnitude gap
favoring GPU.
**Status:** Reference for CPU comparison narrative in our docs.

### OneBit (NeurIPS 2024, arxiv:2402.11295)
**Takeaway:** Quant-training framework with matrix-decomp initialization.
Achieves 81% of non-quantized LLaMA performance with pure 1-bit weights.
**Relevance:** Training-time method, not kernel work. Would feed weights into
our Phase 5 inference path.
**Status:** No kernel action.
